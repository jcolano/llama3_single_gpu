## Model Without Model Parallelism
This repository contains a modified version of the model.py file from the original project, tailored for environments where model parallelism is not used or not feasible. The changes made ensure that the model operates correctly without relying on the model parallel group.

### Changes Made
Removed Model Parallelism Dependencies:

1. All references and functionalities related to model parallelism have been removed from model.py.
Replaced model parallel specific code with alternatives that work in single-device or non-parallel environments.
Updated Layer Implementations:

2. Adjusted layer definitions and initialization to work without parallel processing.
Ensured that model operations are compatible with standard tensor operations on a single device or non-parallel setup.
Function Modifications:

3. Modified functions to handle tensor operations and parameter sharing in a non-parallel environment.
Ensured compatibility with standard PyTorch setups.
